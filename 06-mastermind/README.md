Names: Keenan Lindsey, Trevor Gibb, Ismael Tenango, and Michael Johnson.

10.20 update:
*  Board class is nearly finished.
*  Keenan needs to send the names of the players to the Board class via an 
   AddMe method call.
10.22 update:
*  Keenan please don't forget to call AddPlayer() when you send me new names in 
   DoOutputs() instead of calling my constructor
