Names: Keenan Lindsey

Things we need to fix:
* Make it so that the text "Buffer: " Always appears before the buffer does.
   This means that we need to create a new actor in Director with the text
   "Buffer: ", and display that before we display what is in the actual buffer. This also means that the position of buffer may need to be displaced a little bit to the right to make space for the word 
   "Buffer: ".
*  Every time the user enters "Enter" we need to clear the buffer
*  Make it so that the words disappear whent they reach the left edge of the screen.
